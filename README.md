# Hi, I'm Neeraj 👋

**Software Architect | .NET & Azure | Distributed Systems & Reactive Streams**

I architect and build scalable enterprise applications using .NET Core, Azure, and microservices patterns. 16 years of turning complex business problems into elegant technical solutions. Currently exploring reactive programming with Scala and Pekko Streams.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
```
Primary Stack:
  Architecture:  Microservices | CQRS | Event Sourcing | DDD
  Backend:       .NET Core 2.2-8 | C# | ASP.NET Core | Web API
  Cloud:         Azure (AKS, PaaS, DevOps) | Docker | Kubernetes
  Data:          SQL Server | MongoDB | Elasticsearch
  DevOps:        CI/CD | Azure DevOps | Jenkins | Git

Learning & Exploring:
  Functional:    Scala | Pekko Streams | Akka patterns
  Languages:     Go | Python
  Paradigms:     Reactive Programming | Functional Programming
```

## 💼 What I Do

- Design event-sourced distributed systems handling millions of transactions
- Optimize performance-critical applications (recent: 800ms → 250ms)
- Lead technical architecture for international teams
- Mentor engineers on cloud-native development
- Establish quality standards and architectural best practices

## 🌱 Currently Learning

- **Scala & Pekko Streams** - reactive stream processing, backpressure handling, and functional reactive patterns
- **Functional Programming** - applying FP principles to distributed systems design
- **Go** - for high-performance microservices
- **Python** - data processing and automation
- **Azure Certifications** - AZ-305, AZ-204

## 🎯 Interests

**Technical:**
- Reactive streaming architectures (Pekko/Akka model)
- Event-driven systems with backpressure
- Functional programming in distributed contexts
- Cloud-native patterns and microservices
- Performance engineering at scale

**Architectural Philosophy:**
Combining the type safety and composability of functional programming (Scala) with the pragmatism of .NET ecosystem and reactive patterns from Pekko Streams to build robust distributed systems.

## 🤝 Looking to Collaborate On

- Reactive streaming projects (Pekko Streams, Akka)
- Open source .NET/Azure/Scala projects
- Microservices architecture patterns
- Functional programming patterns for distributed systems
- Performance optimization challenges
- Code reviews and architectural discussions
- Knowledge sharing on event-driven architectures

## 📚 Beyond Code

Avid reader (Kafka, Dostoevsky, Camus, Proust) and film enthusiast (Kurosawa, Kubrick). I believe understanding human stories makes you a better systems architect - both deal with complexity, structure, and inevitable chaos.
