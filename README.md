# Hi, I'm Neeraj 👋

**Software Architect | .NET & Azure | Building Distributed Systems**

I architect and build scalable enterprise applications using .NET Core, Azure, and microservices patterns. 16 years of turning complex business problems into elegant technical solutions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
```
Architecture:  Microservices | CQRS | Event Sourcing | DDD
Backend:       .NET Core 2.2-8 | C# | ASP.NET Core | Web API
Cloud:         Azure (AKS, PaaS, DevOps) | Docker | Kubernetes
Data:          SQL Server | MongoDB | Elasticsearch
DevOps:        CI/CD | Azure DevOps | Jenkins | Git
```

## 💼 What I Do

- Design event-sourced distributed systems handling millions of transactions
- Optimize performance-critical applications (recent: 800ms → 250ms)
- Lead technical architecture for international teams
- Mentor engineers on cloud-native development
- Establish quality standards and architectural best practices

## 🌱 Currently Learning

- **Go** - for high-performance microservices
- **Python** - data processing and automation
- **Functional Programming** - better patterns for distributed systems
- **Azure Certifications** - AZ-305, AZ-204

## 🤝 Looking to Collaborate On

- Open source .NET/Azure projects
- Microservices architecture patterns
- Performance optimization challenges
- Code reviews and architectural discussions
- Knowledge sharing on distributed systems

## 📚 Beyond Code

Avid reader (Kafka, Dostoevsky, Camus, Proust) and film enthusiast (Kurosawa, Kubrick). I believe understanding human stories makes you a better systems architect - both deal with complexity, structure, and inevitable chaos.
